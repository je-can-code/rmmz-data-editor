# J-MZ aka rmmz-data-editor
### An alternative GUI for editing RMMZ database data.

This solution represents a windows winforms application that acts as a GUI for
modifying various tags and values on database objects for RMMZ (RPG Maker MZ).

It will provide a friendly user interface with toggles and controls for making
changes to various database data that would otherwise only be modifyable by
fiddling manually with hand-typed string values within the "note" field of said
database objects.

> CAUTION: If you encountered this without being directed to it, it would be
> important to recognize this is a work-in-progress that covers primarily just
> JABS-related tag modification. There are future intentions for adding extra
> fields for modifying additional data not only from the database object
> itself, but also other plugin tags.
